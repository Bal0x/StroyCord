# D-Key Bot (Previously JE REVIENS OF DEVILKING)
Since the recent action of youtube to close the most used bots on discord, I had the desire to create my own.
This project being at the beginning "Je Reviens Of DevilKing", so it can also sends the message "I'll be back" every time a specific user disconnects from a specific discord voice room and allow you to "feur" your friends.
