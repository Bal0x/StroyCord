# D-Key Bot (Previously JE REVIENS OF DEVILKING)
Since the recent action of youtube to close the most used bots on discord, I had the desire to create my own.
This project being at the beginning "Je Reviens Of DevilKing", it can also sends the message "I'll be back" every time a specific user disconnects from a specific discord voice room and also allow you to "feur" your friends.

## What does the bot use?
The bot uses :
 - Discord.JS - [Website](https://discord.js.org/#/) - [Github repository](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js/)
 - dotenv - [dotenv on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)
 - esm - [esm on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/esm)
 - Heroku Buildpack FFMPEG - [website](https://github.com/jonathanong/heroku-buildpack-ffmpeg-latest)
